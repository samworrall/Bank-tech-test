# Bank Tech Test

This is the Bank Tech Test from tech test week at Makers Academy, designed to prepare us for the job searching process.

The aim of this test is to show OOP skills, along with an understanding of basic OOP concepts such as single responsibility, whilst keeping code DRY, readable, and easily changed.

This project will be 100% test driven.
